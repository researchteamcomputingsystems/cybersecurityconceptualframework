                            Relationship between Smart Industry, Edge Computing, and the Internet of Things.
                        </h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            As is well known, Smart Industry refers to the application of advanced technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics to optimize the vast majority of aspects of industrial production. For example, it enhances operational efficiency through process automation and optimizes decision-making thanks to the analysis of large volumes of data in real time. In this sense, the relationship between Smart Industry and technologies like Edge Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is very close and complementary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In particular, IoT enables the interconnection of physical devices (sensors, actuators, machines, vehicles, etc.) through the internet, allowing these devices to communicate with each other and with centralized control systems. In the context of Smart Industry, IoT facilitates the complete digitalization of operations, enabling complex actions such as: 1) Real-time monitoring of the status of machines and processes, 2) Collecting data on performance, operating conditions, and product quality, and 3) Optimizing logistics and predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, Edge Computing can be interpreted as a process that allows data processing to occur closer to where it is generated (at the edge of the network), meaning on the devices themselves or on nearby servers, rather than sending all data to the cloud for processing. This has several advantages in the context of Smart Industry, including: 1) Reduced latency; by processing data locally, faster and real-time decisions can be made, which is crucial for industrial operations that require immediate responses (for example, adjusting the speed of a production line or stopping a machine if a fault is detected). 2) Lower network load, as only relevant data is sent to the cloud or control center, reducing bandwidth consumption and improving communication efficiency. And 3) Better scalability, as distributed processing facilitates the growth of industrial infrastructure without overloading central systems. For example, sensors in an industrial plant can process data locally on an Edge Computing device (such as a gateway or microserver) to detect abnormal patterns or potential failures, and only send alerts or important data to the cloud.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this sense, it can be inferred that IoT and Edge Computing can collaborate to enhance the concept of Smart Industry. Hypothetically, IoT devices collect real-time data from the production environment, while Edge Computing allows that data to be processed and analyzed locally, reducing latency and improving responsiveness. Furthermore, Edge Computing enables Smart Industry to operate with minimal dependence on the cloud, allowing for local and immediate decision-making, which is crucial in industrial environments where delays can result in economic losses or even accidents. Another aspect to consider is that IoT and Edge Computing contribute to the formation of intelligent environments where constant monitoring of industrial processes could be natural. For example, IoT devices can continuously and autonomously communicate information so that this data can then be quickly processed by Edge Computing, without the need for all data to be sent to the cloud, optimizing both costs and response times.

                            Cybersecurity in IoT and Edge Computing environments for Smart Industry.
                        </h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Despite the benefits of smart industrial environments that integrate IoT and Edge Computing, there are several critical aspects that must be considered for their proper implementation and efficient and effective operation. Undoubtedly, one of the most important is the cybersecurity of the systems involved. In this regard, it is imperative to consider that IoT devices often have limited hardware and software, which makes it difficult to implement robust security mechanisms. Many devices do not receive security updates regularly, making them highly vulnerable to attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A common scenario involves the lack of adequate encryption, both for the data transmitted between IoT devices and for Edge Computing systems. This can be a significant attack vector, as unencrypted communication means that all information traveling through the system is compromised. Therefore, it is highly recommended to implement end-to-end encryption systems that do not affect the latency or critical performance of real-time devices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another cybersecurity risk arises from the lack of authentication and access control. In many industrial environments, weak authentication strategies and inadequate access controls are often found, leading to vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to critical systems. This is especially problematic when dealing with Edge Computing platforms that interconnect multiple devices with applications and services in the cloud. This situation highlights the need to develop more robust authentication mechanisms and access controls to protect each component of the system. Additionally, Edge Computing architectures tend to be distributed and less centralized, making it difficult to implement uniform security solutions. The lack of visibility over distributed devices and the use of multiple platforms increases the risk of security breaches. The situation worsens as more IoT devices and Edge Computing platforms are implemented in the system, making it more challenging to achieve complete visibility of traffic and activities. This can hinder the early detection of intrusions and anomalous behaviors.

                        <h3>
                            The objective of the proposed framework.
                        </h3>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Considering the previous context, the framework for incorporating cybersecurity in Edge Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) environments for Smart Industry aims to provide a starting point for integrating effective, efficient, and reliable security solutions focused on protecting IoT devices, securely managing data, and implementing robust controls in Edge Computing architectures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve this, the framework coherently intertwines SecDevOps and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, leveraging the similarities and shared purposes of both strategies. SecDevOps is an approach that combines software development practices (DevOps) with a deeper integration of security. Instead of leaving the responsibility for security to just one part of the team, SecDevOps promotes that all team members, from developers to new hires, adopt security principles throughout all phases of the software development lifecycle, minimizing risks and preventing security issues later on. This approach includes two fundamental pillars: 1) Security as Code (SaC), and 2) Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Thus, the goal of SecDevOps in the context of IoT and Edge Computing is to build applications and systems that are not only efficient but also resilient to cyberattacks, ensuring that vulnerabilities are managed from the early stages of development rather than at later stages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides key guidelines to help organizations manage risks and protect their networks and data. This framework is organized into five fundamental areas: 1) Identify, 2) Protect, 3) Detect, 4) Respond, and 5) Recover.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this sense, the proposed framework is envisioned as a basic yet reliable alternative for implementing cybersecurity in Edge Computing and IoT environments, particularly in the realm of Smart Industry, by promoting and facilitating the implementation of strategies such as:
