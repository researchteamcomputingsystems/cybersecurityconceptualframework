# Cybersecurity Conceptual Framework Applied to Edge Computing and Internet of Things Environments

## Introduction

This Framework, based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), centers around governance by considering the following key points:
	•	Technological Governance: Ensures that infrastructure, devices, and Edge & IoT platforms comply with security standards by using identity management mechanisms, network segmentation, data encryption, and continuous monitoring. Implementing secure architectures along with patch management and vulnerability response policies strengthens resilience against cyber threats.
	•	Process Governance: Defines strategies for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents in Edge Computing & IoT. This includes establishing secure deployment protocols, risk management, regular audits, and incident response, ensuring the organization’s operational continuity.
	•	Governance of Roles and People: Recognizes that cybersecurity is not only a technological issue but also an organizational one. This Framework establishes a responsibility model where each participant understands their role in protecting digital assets. It also emphasizes the need for continuous training and fostering a culture of cybersecurity throughout the organization.

Note: By adopting this Cybersecurity Framework, companies, organizations, and institutions can improve their security posture, ensuring effective risk management and operational resilience in a constantly evolving digital ecosystem. Its application not only ensures compliance with international regulations and standards but also strengthens trust in the technological infrastructure, guaranteeing data security, privacy, and business continuity.
